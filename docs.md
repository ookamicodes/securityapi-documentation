## URL Scanner

**How its works:**
 SecurityAPI will compare the URL with the database. If this link is received in the DB, it means that this URL is a unsecure/malwares/iploggers/virus/phishing/scam URL. The scan results are made by reactions.

**Reaction Interpretation**
- üîç: The URL is being scanned.

- üü•: The URL is a malware/virus/iplogger/scam/phishing URL.

- üü®: The URL is unsecure (http) or is a URL Shrink.

- If there is no longer any visible reaction, it means that the URL is not a threat.

**Registered**

- Phishing/scam: 400+

- Malwares/Virus: 13 *(in progress)*

- URL Shrinks: 10

- IP-Logger: 4

## Setup

SecurityAPI is really easy to setup but I will introduce here how to do that.

To setup the bot and become more information type: ``` s!config```. Under the config help you will see `s!muteconfig`. This is a introducion how to setup the anti spam&raid.


Make a role named "Muted". Set that role permission "send message" to false. The bot will detect the role automatic. "Muted" needs the capital letter "M" 
After that you dont need to do anything else. This message will show up even if you've already done everything.
