## URL Scanner

**How its works:**
 SecurityAPI will compare the URL with the database. If this link is received in the DB, it means that this URL is a unsecure/malwares/iploggers/virus/phishing/scam URL. The scan results are made by reactions.

**Reaction Interpretation**

- 🔍: The URL is being scanned.
            
- 🟥: The URL is a threat. Users can be harmed.
        
- 🟨: The URL is unsecure (http) or is a URL Shrink.
        
- 🟥 + 💳: The URL is a scamming Website.
        
- 🟥 + 🦠: The URL is a malware/virus Website.

- 🟥 + 📃: The URL is a IP-Logger.
        
- 🟨 + 🔓: The URL doesnt have a secure connection.


- If there is no longer any visible reaction, it means that the URL is not a threat.

**Registered**

- Phishing/scam: 300+

- Malwares/Virus: 600+

- URL Shrinks: 12

- IP-Logger: 16
