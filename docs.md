[ SecurityAPI is really easy to setup but i will introduce here how to do that. ]

To setup the bot and become more information type: ``` s!config```. Under the config help you will see `s!muteconfig`. This is a introducion how to setup the anti spam&raid.


Make a role named "Muted". Set that role permission "send message" to false. The Bot will detect the role automatic. After that you dont need to do something else. This message will come even if you've already done everything.
