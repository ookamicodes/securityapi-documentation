## Setup

[ SecurityAPI is really easy to setup but i will introduce here how to do that. ]

To setup the bot and become more information type: ``` s!config```. Under the config help you will see `s!muteconfig`. This is a introducion how to setup the anti spam&raid.


Make a role named "Muted". Set that role permission "send message" to false. The Bot will detect the role automatic. ** "Muted" needs the capital letter "M" **
After that you dont need to do something else. This message will come even if you've already done everything.
