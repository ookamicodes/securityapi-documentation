## Setup

[ SecurityAPI is really easy to setup but i will introduce here how to do that. ]

To setup the bot and become more information type: ``` s!config```. Under the config help you will see `s!muteconfig`. This is a introducion how to setup the anti spam&raid.


Make a role named "Muted". Set that role permission "send message" to false. The bot will detect the role automatic. ** "Muted" needs the capital letter "M" **
After that you dont need to do anything else. This message will show up even if you've already done everything.

## Coming Soon

We have already planned many things and would like to proudly show and explain what we have in mind.

- Unsecure Website Scanners | Can detect websites that are unsecure (like phishing).
  - For that we will do an submit command whenever you found an unsecure website you can tell us and we add it.
    - Everything is based on reactions.
      - It will take sometimes to make a database with unsecure websites.

- Logs | Will log actions like muted member.
